Answer 1.
There are a few errors in the code that will prevent it from compiling and executing correctly.

First, the include statement should be #include <iostream>, not #inlcude<iostream.h>.

Second, the void main() function should have opening and closing braces {} to enclose the body of the function.

Finally, the cout statement should use lowercase i to match the variable name.

Here's the corrected code:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int i = 0;
    i = 400 * 400 / 400;
    cout << i;
    return 0;
}
 output the value of i, which is 400.
 
 
 
 Answer 2.
 There are several errors in the code:

The #include statement should be #include <iostream>, not Include<iostrearn..h>.

The void main() function should have opening and closing braces {} to enclose the body of the function.

The second line of the function should read int num[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}; instead of Int num[] ={1,2,3,4,5,6,7};.
Here's the corrected code with these errors fixed:
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int num[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    num[1] = num[1] == num[0] ? num[1] : num[0];
    std::cout << "Success";
    return 0;
}

 
 Answer 3.
 There are several errors in the code:

The #include statement should be #include <iostream>, not #include<iostream.h>.

The opening brace { after void main() I is misplaced and should be moved to the next line after switch(1).

The keyword default is misspelled as defaul tt.

The case statements are missing a colon : after the case value and should be separated by a newline instead of a semicolon ;.

The break. statement has an extra period . at the end and should be changed to break;.

The case 1 statement is missing a colon : after the case value and should have a break; statement after it to terminate the case.

The continue statement should not be used outside of a loop, and it does not make sense in the current context. It should be removed from the code.

The variable i used in the i-- statement at the end of the switch block is not defined or initialized anywhere in the code.

Answer 4.

There are several errors in the code:

The #include statement should be #include <iostream>, not #include<iostream.h>.

There is a space in the voi d keyword in the main() function declaration that should be removed.

The function circlearea is misspelled as circleArea in its declaration, causing a function not declared error.

The function squareArea has a typo in the multiplication operator *= instead of *.

The function circlearea has a typo in the closing parenthesis of the function body, which should be a curly brace }.

The function circlearea should return a double value instead of an int, since the area of a circle can be a decimal value.

The cout statement for circlearea is missing a newline character \n at the end of the output.

Answer 5.

(a) There is an extra period at the end of the declaration of variable x. It should be removed.

(b) There is no declaration for the variable vp. This statement will result in a compilation error.

(c) The variable three is not defined anywhere in the code. It should either be declared and initialized to a value or replaced with a numeric constant.

(d) The new operator needs to be followed by a data type to create a new object of that type. The statement should be changed to int *p = new int; to create a new integer object.

(e) The keyword coast should be spelled as const.

(f) The variable p is declared as a float, but is initialized with an integer value 2345. Either the variable should be declared as an int or the initialization value should be a float value.

(g) else is a keyword in C++, so it cannot be used as a variable name. The statement will result in a compilation error.

(h) The variable a is declared as a char, but the string literal 'welcome' contains more than one character. Either the variable should be declared as a character array or the string literal should be changed to a single character enclosed in single quotes 'w'.
